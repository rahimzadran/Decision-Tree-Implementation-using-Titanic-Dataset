# Titanic Decision Tree Implementation

This project uses a **Decision Tree** to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features like age, sex, fare, etc.

## Steps:
1. **Data preprocessing**: Dropped irrelevant columns, filled missing values, and encoded categorical features.
2. **Model**: Used **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the survival status.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using accuracy and classification report.
4. **Visualized the decision tree**: Visual representation of the decision rules.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Decision-Tree-Implementation-using-Titanic-Dataset.git`.
2. Install required libraries: 
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
